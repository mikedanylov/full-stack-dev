  "readme": "## Browsersync recipes.\n\nThere are endless amounts of possible integrations and workflow scenarios when using Browsersync, so this project is an \nattempt to highlight as many of them as we can, whilst providing full, working examples.\n\nHere's what we have currently...\n\n- [Grunt, SASS, HTML/CSS injection example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/grunt.html.injection)\n- [Grunt &amp; SASS](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/grunt.sass)\n- [Grunt, SASS &amp; Autoprefixer](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/grunt.sass.autoprefixer)\n- [Browserify, Babelify + Watchify + Sourcemaps Example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/gulp.browserify)\n- [Gulp, SASS + Jade Templates](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/gulp.jade)\n- [Gulp &amp; Ruby SASS](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/gulp.ruby.sass)\n- [Gulp &amp; SASS](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/gulp.sass)\n- [Gulp &amp; Swig Templates](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/gulp.swig)\n- [Gulp, SASS + Slow running tasks](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/gulp.task.sequence)\n- [HTML/CSS injection example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/html.injection)\n- [Middleware + CSS example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/middleware.css.injection)\n- [Server example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server)\n- [Server with pre-gzipped assets example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server.gzipped.assets)\n- [Server includes example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server.includes)\n- [Server + Logging + History API fallback middlewares Example](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server.middleware)\n- [Webpack + Babel](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/webpack.babel)\n- [Webpack + Monkey Hot Loader](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/webpack.monkey-hot-loader)\n- [Webpack + React Hot Loader](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/webpack.react-hot-loader)\n- [Webpack + React Transform HMR](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/webpack.react-transform-hmr)\n\n... each one is a full, working example - just have a look at the `readme.md` in each one for installation\ninstructions.\n\n\n### Contributions / Feedback\n\nSpotted an error? Couldn't get one of the examples running? Have your own sweet setup that you want to show off to the world?\nWe'd love to receive your feedback and contributions - so please get in touch! We aim to make this project the canonical source \nof example projects & code snippets related to running Browsersync.\n\n### How to contribute an example\n\nFirst thing you should do, is take a look at our [simplest example here](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server) - \nthis will give you a great head-start on setting up your code.\n\nThen, `fork` this repo and `clone` your fork down to your local machine. Now create a new folder inside `recipes`\n(note the naming structure). This is where you create your awesome example. You're free to do as you like,\nbut there are a couple of rules you'll need to follow to ensure the project can build.\n\n**Required Files**\n\n- `package.json` (see below for requirements)\n- `app.js` (or any JS file showing the example)\n- `./app` directory. Always include the minimum HTML, JS & CSS needed to prove your example.\n\n**Do NOT include**\n- `readme.md` (this is created dynamically for you)\n- any other files that are not related to your example.\n\n\n### package.json requirements\n\n\n**start command**: For consistency, ensure your example can be run with the command `npm start`. To \ndo this, you just need to provide something along these lines:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node app.js\"\n},\n```\n\n**main file**: We inline your main Javascript file into the `readme.md`, so\ndon't miss this field.\n\n```json\n\"main\": \"app.js\" // or gulpfile.js etc\n```\n\n**description**: We use this as the Title. So make it short and descriptive, such as \n\n```json\n\"description\": \"Server example\"\n```\n\n### Finally, build.\nAfter you've added your example in the recipes folder, return to the root and run\n\n```bash\nnpm install && npm run build\n```\n\nThis will install [Crossbow.js](https://github.com/shakyShane/crossbow.js) and compile the project.\nCommit everything that has changed and push it up to your fork. Send a Pull Request when you're\nready, or if you'd like us to have a look over your code before that, just ping us [twitter](https://twitter.com/browsersync) and we'll \ntake a look! ",
